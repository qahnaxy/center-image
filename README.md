## Center Image

[Center Image](https://github.com/qahnaxy/centerImage/) is a minimalist yet effective plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that programmatically centers image elements within both the Editor and Live Preview modes. It applies a clean, standardized CSS border-radius for a modern, polished aesthetic.

## Installation & Configuration

- **Install** the plugin via Obsidian's Community Plugins browser.

- **Enable** the plugin within your settings.

- No further configuration is required. The plugin is immediately active upon activation.

## Planned Feature Roadmap

- **Configurable Alignment**: Granular control over image alignment (e.g., left, center, right) on a per-image or global basis.

- **Customizable Styling**: A settings panel to user-define the border-radius value (in pixels or percent) and potentially other CSS properties.

- **Plugin Interoperability**: Official compatibility and styling support for the popular Image Captions plugin.

## Future Development Note

Please **monitor this repository** for updates. A comprehensive advanced image plugin is in active development, which will incorporate all the features listed above, along with additional advanced functionality for image and asset management. **Qahnaxy** here, peace out.
